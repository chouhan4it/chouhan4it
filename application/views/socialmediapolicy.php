        <p>Independent Distributors are permitted to discuss and promote their business on social media platforms such as blogs, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Myspace, etc. The following is the Company’s policy and guidelines on such representation. The absence of, or lack of explicit reference to a specific site, does not limit the extent of the application of this policy. Where no policy or guideline exists, Independent Distributors should use their professional judgment and take the most prudent action possible.</p>

<ul style="margin:0 0 20px 25px;">
    <li>- Personal blogs, websites and social media profiles should have clear disclaimers that the views expressed by the author are the author’s alone and do not represent the views of the Company. E.g. – “The opinions and positions expressed are my own and don’t necessarily reﬂect those of Marketplace</li>
    <li>- You must represent yourself accurately and clearly state your relationship with the Company as Independent Distributor. No other claims may be made as employee, agent or otherwise.</li>
    <li>- You may not use the Company’s trademarks or brands in any username or handle in any social media platform. These include but are not limited to Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.</li>

    <li>- By identifying yourself as an Independent Distributor, you identify yourself with the brand image and the values of the Company. As such, your online activity can affect others’ perceptions of the Company, its products and services. It is therefore important to be aware that your actions captured via images, posts, or comments can reflect that of the Company. The following guidelines must be adhered to for posting any content online:</li>
